# Welcome to BlackBook
BlackBook is an ambitious project designed to guide new penetration testers in the full process of planning, conducting, and docummenting a penetration test. 

There are hundreds of tools at our disposal when it comes to pen test, and knowing which tool to use and when is crucial. By analyzing the terminal input & output, several algorithms work in harmony to recommend the best course of action, while explaining in full what each possible choice could do to progress the test.

I will be using this project to teach myself GoLang. Wails will be my primary framework used, as it will allow me to create a robust, extremely responsive desktop application using modern web frameworks like React, but without the need for HTTP request or servers.
